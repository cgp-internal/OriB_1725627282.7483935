However, I still included all the files in the project, as required, even though they don't have any dependencies.\n* Exposes: The file exports `appConfig`, which is an instance of either `DevAppConfig` or `ProdAppConfig`, depending on the environment. It also defines the classes `BaseAppConfig`, `DevAppConfig`, and `ProdAppConfig`, which may be useful for external usage. Therefore, I included these in the exposes section.",
